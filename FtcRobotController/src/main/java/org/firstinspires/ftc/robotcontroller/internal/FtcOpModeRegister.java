	 * There are two mechanisms by which an OpMode may be registered.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * 1) The preferred method is by means of class annotations in the OpMode
	 * itself. See, for example the class annotations in
	 * {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller.external.samples.ConceptNullOp}.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * 2) The other, retired, method is to modify this
	 * {@link #register(OpModeManager)} method to include explicit calls to
	 * OpModeManager.register(). This method of modifying this file directly is
	 * discouraged, as it makes updates to the SDK harder to integrate into your
	 * code.
